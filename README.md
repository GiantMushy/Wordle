Gagnsaskipan Programming Assignment 6 / Wordl

- This was a smalll assingment to create a functional Wordle program, which I put a little extra elbow grease into

### How to play
- To start the program, simply run the `Wordle.py` file.
- The length of the guessed word is then chosen, as well as the number of guesses you are allowed.
- More points are awarded for longer words, as well as fewer guesses
- The scoreboard is only saved locally in a csv file.
